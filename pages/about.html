            <p>
                In this School, we're brothers and sisters<br>
                In this School, we learn to pray,<br>
                For God is our true Father<br>
                And Guides us on our way<br>
            </p>
                
            <h3>Chorus:</h3>
            <p>
                Oh, it's fine, it's grand, it's marvelous<br>
                St. Xavier's Gold and Blue!<br>
                We learn to serve our fellow-men<br>
                For God and country too.<br>
                Rich and Poor, we come together<br>
                Lending all a helping hand,<br>
                People of all religions<br>
                As one family we stand.<br>
                Our School is a place of learning<br>
                But it gives us as we put in,<br>
                It molds and builds our character<br>
                To face the world and win.<br>
                - Fr. G.A. Drinane, S.J.<br>
