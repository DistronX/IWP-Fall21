                Dear Parents, Students and well wishers,<br>
                As the new Principal of this esteemed institution with a well-respected legacy of providing exceptional educational outcomes and opportunities for young minds since 1941, I cordially welcome you to the website of St. Xavier’s Sr. Sec. School, Jaipur.
                It is my pleasure and honour to be working with a school that inherits a rich legacy. I am truly privileged to be a part of this revered institution which has already given me such a warm and heartfelt welcome, in just the few interactions till now, it’s become crystal clear that this temple of wisdom and knowledge is a unique one.
                School provides a platform for the cognitive, affective and psycho-motor development of Children who are rapidly changing physically, socially, intellectually and emotionally. Our excellent staff and learning environment are prepared to meet the challenge of ensuring success during the child’s early adolescent years. We help to instill in our children a keen social conscience and the capacity to make ethical decisions to help them become future leaders and role models of society.
                My clarion call to all parents is to get involved by staying in contact with the school and in particular your child’s teacher. Our expectations will be to make sure you are aware of your child’s progress and we will answer any queries or concerns you have. This modus operandi of dual monitoring will help ensure the integral formation of our children.
                I feel fortunate for this new leadership role and look forward to embarking on another exciting, rewarding and memorable academic year.
                <br>Sincerely,
